<inputfile> structure:
It has only one root namely 0(it there are multiple source nodes, add node 0 on top of them)
Other nodes are numbered from 1,2,3,....

Line 1 : <num_nodes> <num_edges>
Lines 2 to num_edges+1(list of edges) : <src_node> <dst_node>

In the command line(while running):
lock <num_nodes> <node1> <node2> ....
unlock <num_nodes> <node1> <node2> ....
